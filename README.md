# orbit-sim
A program to simulate the orbits of the planets in the solar system. Inspired by our high school physics teacher.

Made for DAHacks 3.0.

## Features
- Adjustable mass of Sun and individual planets
- Show and hide planets
- Planet information display
  - Mass
  - Orbital Radius
  - Orbital Speed
  - Gravitational Force
  - Acceleration
  - Total Energy

## What it does
This program simulates the elliptical orbits of the planets around the sun. You can show/hide all of the planets, adjust the speed of the simulation, and adjust the masses of the Sun and the individual planets.

The program will output certain physics calculations using real formulas and real values that will change depending on the input. Information includes:

- Mass
- Orbit radius
- Orbital speed
- Gravitational force
- Acceleration
- Total energy

## How we built it
This project is built purely in Python 3.9.

## Challenges we ran into
During the development of this project we ran into various issues. One of our team members had to actually learn Python within a few hours. 

Our primary challenge came when trying to write and implement our calculationsâ€”we wanted to make sure that our results and simulation are as accurate as possible.
